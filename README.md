# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Junho Park, a passionate developer with expertise in AI, game development, and problem-solving. I enjoy building projects that challenge my creativity and technical skills. 

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goal
My goal is to continuously improve my game development skills, focusing on creating **engaging, and user-friendly games**. Eventually, I aim to collaborate on more complex gaming projects, contributing to both **indie games** and larger scale game development teams.
